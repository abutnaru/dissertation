\chapter*{Abstract}
%[The text within the square brackets must be deleted along with the square brackets when finalising your own abstract. 

%The abstract for an undergraduate dissertation should be between 200 - 350 words.

%Arial, Normal, 11pt with 1.2 or 1.5 line spacing should be used. The text in this part has 1.5 line spacing.

%An abstract is a brief, accurate and comprehensive summary of the entire dissertation. It is the first thing to be read by your examiners to help them know the brief content of the dissertation. It also serves as a “sales pitch” to form the first impression of your work. 

%A good abstract should be accurate, self-contained, concise, specific and clear. A quick way to assess the quality of your abstract is to check whether it answers the questions why, how, what and so what.

%It is easier to write the Abstract the last.]
