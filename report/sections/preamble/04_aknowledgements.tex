\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
I want to thank my project supervisor Alexios Mylonas for the support provided throughout the development of this dissertation. Also, thank you for steering me towards a more approachable subject; your guidance is much appreciated. I also extend my thanks to Alexandru Serban for sharing his expertise in data science and for the time he took to guide me through some of the base concepts of machine learning.

Lastly, I would like to acknowledge and show gratitude to my fiancee and my little brother for the much-needed motivation and emotional support not only during my dissertation but during these four years as well.
