\chapter{Conclusion}
The Conclusions chapter marks the end of the project report and it is a summary which brings together many of the points that you have made in other chapters, especially in the previous chapter. It is usually 2 â€“ 3 pages long with three sections:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Summary: summarise what you have achieved and restate the main results
	\item Evaluation: evaluate what you have achieved and how well you have met the objectives
	\item Future work: explain any limitations and how things might be improved.]
\end{enumerate}
