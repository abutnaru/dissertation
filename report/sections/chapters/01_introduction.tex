This chapter will begin by introducing the issue to be addressed throughout
this dissertation, stating the current situation and analyze it from the
perspective of existing solutions. The following section outlines the project
rationale and presents the intended outcomes. The next section states the
objectives and relationship between them, after which it details the method of
critically evaluating the project's success criteria. The penultimate section
describes the risk analysis performed and the proactive actions which will be
taken to mitigate the identified risks. Finally, the last section presents an

\section{Problem definition}
% Discuss statistics and identity theft
While the exploitation of trust or personality traits such as agreeableness or
obedience is not a new phenomenon, the internet has brought about a new
framework in which such activities can be conducted. Comparing the
aforementioned to a face-to-face setting, the former provides several advantages
for the attacker such as anonymity and a greater geographical reach. Once with
this contextual shift, the term "phishing" has been popularized. Phishing is
described as a scam by which an internet user is manipulated into disclosing
personal or confidential information that the attacker can use illicitly
\citep{MERRIAM_WEBSTER}.

In it's primitive form, a phishing attack requires elementary technical
knowledge. The main skills required are the ones easily transferable from
manipulation or deceit in face-to-face interaction. This amongst other reasons
outlined in the following subsections, have contributed to the growth in
popularity of phishing attacks in the past twenty-five years.

\subsection{Current situation}
The increase in the popularity of phishing is seen in the numbers registered by the
Anti-Phishing Working Group \citep{APWG} across the years. Their archives open
with the reports from across 2004. These add up to 33.5 thousand unique registered phishing attacks with missing data for September. After fifteen years, the \gls{APWG} registered
479,468 unique phishing attacks in 2019. Besides the growth in numbers, the
aforementioned reports outline a clear advancement in the technical aspects of
the registered phishing campaigns over the years. An example of evolution is the
adoption of Transport Layer Security (\gls{TLS}) used to serve phishing websites over
Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (\gls{HTTPS}). Reported usage has grown from close to zero percent in 2016, to sixty-eight percent by the end of the third quarter of 2019 \citep{APWG_Q42019}.

\subsection{Existing solutions}
In most cases, the only source of protection against accessing phishing websites
the user has is the browser. Browser usage statistics show that Google
Chrome, Apple Safari, and Mozilla Firefox comprise 86.59\% \citep{STATCOUNTER} of the market share. All of these browsers use Google Safe Browsing (\gls{GSB}) as their anti-phishing detection
system. At the surface level, this is a black-list based service which provides
the aforementioned browsers with a list of malicious URLs through its
Application Programming Interface (\gls{API}).

\begin{figure}[t]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.90\textwidth]{browser_marketshare.png}
	\caption{Browser market share \citep{STATCOUNTER}}
	\label{fig:BROWSER_MARKETSHARE}
\end{figure}
% Figure showing browser market share
% Look at issues with Google Safe-Browsing

Although Google Safe Browsing acts as a black-list, underneath this compilation
of malicious URLs lies an entire process of scrutinization. Based on it, the
decision-making mechanism chooses whether the URL of the studied web page should
be added to the black-list. Leaving classification accuracy aside, the time needed for this process to finalize and update the list renders the solution suboptimal. The
core issue is that malicious actors are quick in conducting these phishing attacks and
often go under Google Safe Browsing's radar. Given that the reported median phishing webpage lifespan is of less than twenty-four hours, speed is a key factor in defending against them.

The maintenance of this type of black-list is resource-expensive. This could be the
reason why three of the major browsers are using the same anti-phishing solution
despite its effectiveness.

Another anti-phishing detection system worth mentioning is Microsoft SmartScreen. SmartScreen is embedded in the Windows operating system and delivers protection against a wide range of threats. Phishing protection is offered through Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Edge browsers which represents 4.25\% of the market share. Although SmartScreen is marketed as delivering better protection than Google Safe Browsing, the difference reported by the literature is of 2.6\%. One important mention is that the analysis is done off-site, thus plenty of information has to be sent to Microsoft's servers for processing. Depending on the circumstances, doing so might have an impact on privacy.

In conclusion, the user's main defense against phishing is not versatile or robust enough to keep up with the speed and sophistication of these attacks. 


\section{Project rationale and outcomes}
The trends and statistics outline the fact that phishing will remain a prevalent
type of attack for the foreseeable future. However, the protection
mechanisms of the main medium of interaction with phishing webpages are not
satisfactory, as shown by the amount of financial damage reported every year
\citep{APWG_Q42019}. Furthermore, identity theft is difficult to recover from,
and it takes time and effort.

Given the lack of empirical tests in evaluating Google Safe Browsing's level of protection, an investigation of the effectiveness and accuracy needs to be carried out. This evaluation and further research serve as a starting point for developing an improvement. As a next step, the relevant literature should be corroborated and the most appropriate elements and features stacked together and implemented. The said implementation is meant to outperform Google Safe Browsing while considering the circumstances and priorities of such protection system.

To the best of my knowledge, there has been no other approach structured as
previously described, which comprises the motivation of the project. There are
not many iterations of anti-phishing detection systems either aiming to outperform Google Safe Browsing or target users with reduced technical literacy.

\section{Aim and objectives}

\subsection{Aim}
The intended functional outcome of the project is a piece of software that
addresses the issues of phishing detection systems described in this
chapter. The first step in doing so is to develop the means to evaluate the
efficiency of Google Safe Browsing, this being the most used anti-phishing
detection system by a large margin. The second step will be composed of research, design, and
development of an improved solution.

\section{Risk Analysis}

Considering the nature of this dissertation and the extensive amount it
plans to achieve, a risk analysis is a useful resource. This will assure a
proactive stance regarding the obstacles that are to be encountered. Besides the
resilience it offers, it helps in acknowledging areas where problems may arise
and prioritize work items based on this.

Table \ref{tab:RISK_ANALYSIS} presents the main identified risks related to
this project. Each of these has a likelihood and impact dimension attributed to
help outline the hierarchy of prioritization.

\section{Overview of the dissertation}
Chapter two explores the relevant literature and introduces previous work done
on the subject. Chapter three describes the artefact design and implementation methodology, as well as the evaluation process of both the Google safe Browsing evaluator and artefact. Chapter four offers an in-depth view of the development process. Furthermore, it presents the process of model calibration and performance enhancement. The fifth chapter compares what is achieved in the previous one against Google Safe Browsing and places the artefact's performance in the literature landscape. The last chapter presents an high-level view of what has been achieved in this dissertation. It begins with a summarization of the work conducted and close with ways in which the work can be expanded upon.
