	ABSTRACT  = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

	ABSTRACT = {URL blacklists are used by the majority of modern web browsers as a means to protect users from rogue web sites, i.e. those serving malware and/or hosting phishing scams. There is a plethora of URL blacklists/reputation services, out of which Google's Safe Browsing and Microsoft's SmartScreen stand out as the two most commonly used ones. Frequently, such lists are the only safeguard web browsers implement against such threats. In this paper, we examine the level of protection that is offered by popular web browsers on iOS, Android and desktop (Windows) platforms, against a large set of phishing and malicious URL. The results reveal that most browsers – especially those for mobile devices – offer limited protection against such threats. As a result, we propose and evaluate a countermeasure, which can be used to significantly improve the level of protection offered to the users, regardless of the web browser or platform they are using.}
